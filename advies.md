"If I build a layout, how will I interact with it?  Will my satisfaction come from being an operator, railfan, or simply the joy and satisfaction of building things. Maybe **having a miniature copy of a place and time you find truly appealing** is your motivation."

"The key is to get trains rolling from end to end as quickly as possible using temporary track and then doubling back at your leisure to work on whatever area strikes you as interesting on any given weekend.  Having at least the main in front of you, up and running, can do wonders for morale."

"Get the bench work up. If your plan calls for the traditional around the walls center peninsula, consider adding the peninsula later."

"East rail was an ‘instant on’ layout.  In the evening, after my family duties were met, I could grab an ice cold beer, hit the switch, and run.  This, sub-conscious ease of use,  encouraged an atmosphere where I was operating almost daily."

"Well, I need to take a few sections out of storage, mount them on legs, clean some track”, all of which may only take ten or fifteen minutes. Unfortunately, that ten or fifteen minutes of set up, maybe even five, is enough resistance that we hit the television remote instead."

**"Given the choice between a modest layout that requires some set up versus a micro layout that is ‘instant on’ I’d suggest the latter."**

"The key is to get people operating their layouts more frequently and in a way they find extremely interesting.  I’m talking about **frequent sessions that are easy to set up and can be run on a moment’s notice, 15 to 45 minutes at a time**, and doing so three, four, five times a week. [...] Sub-consciously modelers tell themselves that if they can’t do the full three hour session then they just won’t run until they can. It never happens."

"**There is a direct relationship between the desired length of our operating sessions and layout design.**   If we don’t feel the design will provide enough operational interest or a long enough session, we compensate by adding more turnouts…..and more…..and more. [...] By default, the longer it takes to switch a given industry, the fewer industries and less track we need in our designs."

"The third trap, ergonomics, is dangerous because it’s so subtle.  Our discomfort and dissatisfaction with a layout with poor ergonomics is often hidden in our sub-conscious.   We find our enthusiasm dwindling with each passing year and aren’t sure why.  The key word here is ‘easy access’.  It is absolutely critical that ALL track be within easy ‘grab and go’, arms reach, accessible distance.  For your average person this means no further than 27 inches from the fascia.  It also means avoiding hidden track at all costs.  Long tunnels, hidden staging, hard to reach staging are deal killers.  The scary part is the problem isn’t so obvious during the first year when your enthusiasm is so high that you are willing to overlook any and all inconvenience."
